# rnaseq_translator

This project aims to understand the difference between RNA-sequencing types(single-cell, single-nucleus, and bulk RNA-sequencing) and use this information to be able to translate bewteen the data types in order to aid deconvolution methods.
This project is still a work in progress and being updated regularly.
